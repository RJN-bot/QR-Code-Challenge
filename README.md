## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my first unguided project and well I found it pretty tough at the start.

I just did what I knew and kept on at it and voila! the project was almost finished. Made some few adjustments here and there and it was finished.

Also, I learned that although tutorials are good but things are learned through projects (like this one).

Will be focusing more on projects from now on.
